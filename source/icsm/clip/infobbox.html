   By hitting the "Draw..." button an area on the map can be selected with the mouse by clicking a
   corner and while holding the left mouse button
	down drag diagonally across the map to the opposite corner.
	<br/>
   Clicking the "Draw..." button again allows replacing a previous area selection. <br/>
   Alternatively you can type in the minimum and maximum coordinates and search by using the "Manual entry" button.<br/>
	<strong>Notes:</strong>
   <ul>
      <li>The data does not cover all of Australia.</li>
      <li>Restrict a search area to below 1.5 degrees square. eg 2x0.75 or 1x1.5</li>
   </ul>
	<p style="padding-top:5px"><strong>Hint:</strong> If the map has focus, you can use the arrow keys to pan the map.
		You can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel or the "+" and "-" map control on the top left of the map. If you
		don't like the position of your drawn area, hit the "Draw" button and draw a new bounding box.
