            <li>Click on the map, holding the button down,</li>
            <li>Drag to a diagonal corner (not too big, there is a limit of roughly 2 square degrees or 200 square km))</li>
            <li>On release we will check for data within or very near your area of interest</li>
            <li>If the list is large you can filter:
               <ul>

            </li>
            <li>Check against any file you would like to download. To reiterate, these files can be huge so take note of the file size before downloading</li>

      <h5>Hints</h5>
      <p>
         <ul>
            <li>Hovering over many items will give you further information about the purpose of the item</li>
            <li>Drawing a polyline allows you to measure distance along the polyline.</li>
            <li>On completion on drawing a line the elevation along that line is plotted.</li>
            <li>While the tool to draw your area of interest is enabled it is easiest to pan the map using the arrow keys.</li>
            <li>There are many areas where there is no data though the coverage is improving all the time.</li
         </ul>
